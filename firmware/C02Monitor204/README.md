# C02Monitor

This is a port of Kevin Maier's C02Monitor for my SO6502 computer. I updated the basic I/O routines to work with the NXP SC28L92 UART I am using, but everything else was copied from Kevin's GitHub repository.

Kevin, along with many other helpful people, can be found on [6502.org](https://6502.org).
Kevin goes by the name floobydust on 6502.org and GitHub. Check out his GitHub page for more 6502 goodness.

A huge "Thank you!" to Kevin for giving me permission to include his code here.

## Features
- Memory disassembler
- 16-bit timer for uptime timer and accurate software delays
- Enhanced BASIC by Lee Davison
- And more...
